## Synopsis

*Gulp + Shopify* is for those Developers wishing to use [Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/ "Gulp.js website") and Shopify‚Äôs [Theme Kit](https://shopify.github.io/themekit/ "Theme Kit GitHub page") to develop their Shopify theme &ndash; a tidy solution to the problem with Shopify not allowing sub-directories within the `assets` directory.

The theme is packaged with Gulp for watching and compiling assets in the `dev` directory, including SCSS, JS, images, and fonts. When modified, said assets are moved across to the `assets` directory.

A selection of helpful mixins is also included, most of which are featured in [this useful article](http://zerosixthree.se/8-sass-mixins-you-must-have-in-your-toolbox/ "Mixins article") by [@seb_ekstrom](https://twitter.com/seb_ekstrom "@seb_ekstrom on Twitter").

You may also write your JavaScript in ES6 &ndash; The Gulp scripts task uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/ "Babel website"), so you can use the latest syntax without worrying about browser support.

The default theme files have been brought across from Shopify‚Äôs [Starter Theme](https://github.com/Shopify/starter-theme "Starter Theme GitHub page").

The theme includes the Bootstrap 4 grid and reboot scss files. These can be removed in `theme.scss.liquid`, or indeed, you may add more Bootstrap SCSS files using @import via `./node_modules/bootstrap-scss/`.

## Installation

### Gulp.js

Clone the repo into your project root.

In Terminal `cd` into the `dev` directory and install the Gulp packages (if you haven‚Äôt already installed Gulp, you‚Äôll need to [do so](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md "Gulp installation") first):

`npm install`

Once you have installed the packages, in Terminal, run `gulp watch`.

Any changes to the SCSS files in `dev/sass/` will lead to the creation of `theme.scss.liquid` in `assets`.

Any alterations to the JS files in `dev/js/` will be concatenated and uglified in `assets` to `theme.js` and `theme.min.js`.

Images added to `dev/image` will be copied across to the `assets` directory. Similarly, any fonts added to `dev/font` will be copied across to `assets`.

**Tip:** Use the `shopify()` SCSS function to use values declared in `config/settings_schema.json`. For example:

```json
{
  "type": "color",
  "id": "colour_body_text",
  "label": "Body text",
  "default": "#000"
}
```

The HEX value returned from the above example could be used in the SCSS by utilising the `shopify()` function like so:

```css
body {
  color: shopify('colour_body_text');
}
```

or, if declaring a variable, like this:

```scss
$body-color: shopify('colour_body_text');
```

It‚Äôs a neat solution, and you have [@derekmorash](https://gist.github.com/derekmorash/1e82ff9ffdf675ce00af7d0c3c99fb0c) to thank for it!

### Theme Kit

To get Theme Kit up and running, follow the instructions [here](https://shopify.github.io/themekit/#installation "Theme Kit installation instructions").

The `config.yml` file is included in the repo, ready to be filled in with the necessary details.

**Important: DO NOT commit the `config.yml` file to your repo. Add it to the `.gitignore` before committing. The only reason it‚Äôs committed in this repo is to aid Theme Kit newbies get up and running.**

To get started on your theme, follow [these instructions](https://shopify.github.io/themekit/#use-a-new-theme "Theme Kit usage instructions").
